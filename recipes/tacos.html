    <p>Is it taco Tuesday? Or maybe it’s taco Monday or taco Saturday? Tacos make a simple dinner any day of the week. At my house, nobody ever has any complaints about taco night. Tacos with chicken are a slightly out of the ordinary way to serve tacos, especially if you’re more of a ground beef taco kind of family. We always enjoy Baked Chicken Tacos, but these are a bit different. Pulled chicken tacos are a taco option with less fat than beef tacos, and they are packed with bold Mexican flavors. You’ve come to the right place if you are looking for a chicken for tacos recipe.</p>
